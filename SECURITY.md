## Reporting a Vulnerability

### For Template Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project template, please report it responsibly:

**Email:** [civictechwr@gmail.com](mailto:civictechwr@gmail.com) (mention “security” in the subject line)
**GitHub escalation:** Mention `@CivicTechWR/organizers` on an issue or pull request if you need organizer attention.
**Response Time:** Volunteers aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours.

### For Project-Specific Security Issues

If you are using this template for your CivicTechWR project and discover a security issue:

1. **Do not create a public GitHub issue.**
2. **Contact the project team directly** through private channels, or email [civictechwr@gmail.com](mailto:civictechwr@gmail.com) if you are unsure who to reach.
3. **Follow responsible disclosure** by giving maintainers time to investigate and fix the issue before any public discussion.

## Security Reporting Process

### What to Include in Reports

- **Clear description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the security issue
- **Potential impact** on users and community
- **Suggested fix** if you have ideas
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### What Happens Next

1. **Acknowledgment** - We will confirm receipt within 48 hours.
2. **Assessment** - We will evaluate the severity and impact.
3. **Fix development** - We will work on a solution and share timelines when possible.
4. **Disclosure** - We will coordinate responsible disclosure with you.
5. **Recognition** - We will acknowledge your contribution if you would like.

## Security Best Practices for CTWR Projects

### For Project Teams

- **Plan security from the start** by identifying data flows and trust boundaries in project docs or issues.
- **Use secure coding practices** throughout development and review contributions for potential risks.
- **Enable automated scanning** such as GitHub secret scanning, Dependabot alerts, and linting that focuses on security concerns.
- **Review collaborator access quarterly** and remove or reduce access for accounts that have not contributed recently to limit exposure from dormant accounts.
- **Conduct security reviews** before major releases or partner deployments.
- **Onboard volunteers** with guidance on handling sensitive community data.

### For Community Members

- **Report security issues responsibly** by using the private channels listed above.
- **Keep dependencies updated** in your contributions to minimize known vulnerabilities.
- **Follow security guidelines** when contributing code or documentation.
- **Respect user privacy** when testing or providing feedback.

## Civic Tech Security Considerations

### Community Data Protection

Civic tech projects often handle sensitive community data. Special considerations:

- **Privacy by design** - Minimize data collection.
- **Transparency** - Be clear about data use.
- **Community consent** - Get explicit permission for data collection when possible.
- **Secure storage** - Protect any collected data.
- **Data retention** - Delete data when no longer needed.

### Government Partnership Security

When working with government partners:

- **Understand data classification** so you know the sensitivity of information you handle.
- **Follow compliance requirements** aligned to the partner’s standards.
- **Use secure communication** channels for sensitive discussions.
- **Apply access controls** to limit who can access government data.
- **Maintain audit trails** that log access to sensitive systems or records.

## Security Contacts

### How to Reach Us

- **Primary channel:** Email [civictechwr@gmail.com](mailto:civictechwr@gmail.com) (include context or repository name in the subject line).
- **Slack escalation:** Direct message the organizers or post in the private organizers channel if you already have access.
- **GitHub escalation:** Mention `@CivicTechWR/organizers` on the relevant issue or pull request to notify the organizers team.

### Response Expectations

The CivicTechWR security group is volunteer-run and does not maintain a formal SLA. We address reports as quickly as the team is available and will coordinate next steps once someone has acknowledged the issue. If a report seems urgent, use every channel above and add “URGENT” in the subject or message so we can prioritize it when a volunteer is online.

## Security Acknowledgments

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve civic technology:

- **Responsible disclosure** contributors will be acknowledged
- **Security hall of fame** for significant contributions
- **Reference letters** for security researchers (upon request)
- **Community recognition** at Demo Day or community meetings

## Legal Safe Harbor

CivicTechWR projects support security research conducted in good faith:

- **Authorized testing** - Security research on our public systems is permitted
- **No legal action** - We won't pursue legal action for good faith security research
- **Coordinated disclosure** - We'll work with you on responsible disclosure timelines

### Guidelines for Security Research

- **Don't access user data** - Only test with your own accounts/data
- **Don't disrupt service** - Avoid testing that could impact users
- **Respect privacy** - Don't access personal information
- **Report responsibly** - Follow our disclosure process
- **Give us time** - Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
